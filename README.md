This is a library for working with finite graphs, including a brute force decision procedure for finding a path between two nodes in [`Graph.Path.Search`](src/Graph/Path/Search.agda).

# How to build
Building requires the following libraries in an Agda [`defaults` file](http://agda.readthedocs.io/en/v2.5.3/tools/package-system.html):
- [Agda standard library](https://github.com/agda/agda-stdlib) under the name `standard-libarary`
